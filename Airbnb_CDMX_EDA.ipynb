    "# **Ciudad de Mexico Airbnb EDA**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "[InsideAirbnb](https://insideairbnb.com) is a project which scrapes real airbnb listings for the purpose of analysis and advocacy. Airbnb claims to be part of the \"sharing economy\" and disrupting the hotel industry. However, data shows that the majority of Airbnb listing in most cities are entire homes, many of which are rented all year round - disruptiong housing and commuities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main question i want to answer is:\n",
    "### **How is Airbnb really being used in and affecting the neighbourhoods of CDMX?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured question tree:\n",
    "- descriptive->diagnostic->predictive->prescriptive\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's breakdown the question into smaller subquestions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inventory & Distribution**\n",
    "- How many Airbnb listings exists in CDMX, and how are they distributed geograpically\n",
    "- Which colonias have the highest density of listings\n",
    "- What % of housing inventory in each colonia is Airbnb vs. long-term residential units?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Behavious & Usage**\n",
    "- What % of hosts have multiple listings (professional operators) vs. single-unit hosts?\n",
    "- Which neighbourhoods have the highest share of multi-property hosts?\n",
    "- What % of hosts are foreing vs. nationals\n",
    "- Are listings primarily short-stay (<7 days) or long-stay (>28 days) oriented?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Occupancy & Demand**\n",
    "- What are average occuncy rates by colonia?\n",
    "- What is seasonal demand like (high and low months)?\n",
    "- What is the average lenght of stay by neighbourhood?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pricing**\n",
    "- What are nightly prices by area?\n",
    "- How have prices changed YoY?\n",
    "- Are Airbnb prices correlated with tourism hotspots or metro accessibility?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Housing Market**\n",
    "- Do colonias with high Airbnb density also show higher increases in ernt prices (INEGI rent/rate data)\n",
    "- Correlation between Airbnb listing growth and:\n",
    "    - rent increases\n",
    "    - % residents reporting household displacement (if i find it)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Local Economy**\n",
    "- Estimated Airbnb revenue injected into each colonia - Where does the money go?\n",
    "    - % captured by foreing / non-local operators\n",
    "    - potential \"leakage\" where hosts do not reside locally\n",
    "- Are neighbourhood with high Airbnb density seeing:\n",
    "    - growth in restaurants/cafés (openings)\n",
    "    - drop in local traditional commerce?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Social & Urban-Frabic Questions**\n",
    "- Are neighborhoods with high Airbnb use experiencing demographic shifts (proxy metrics: long-stay pricing, English-language listing share)\n",
    "- Which colonias show a mismatch between resident population size and number of active short-term rentals?\n",
    "- Are there signs of \"Airbnb-driven tourism corridors\" (Roma -> Condesa -> Juarez, etc.)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Spatial Questions (dashboards + maps)**\n",
    "- Heatmap: Listings per hectare by colonia\n",
    "- Which Airbnb clusters appear near:\n",
    "    - metro stations\n",
    "    - parks\n",
    "    - tourist attractions\n",
    "    - coworking spaces\n",
    "- Are listing clusters expanding over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Strategic / Policy-Oriented Questions**\n",
    "- Should regulations limit multi-listing hosts in CDMX?\n",
    "- Which olonias are at highest risk of displacement?\n",
    "- Where could Airbnb be redirected to boost tourism in under-visited districts?\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Datasets**\n",
    "- listings.csv.gz: Detailed listings data\n",
    "- listings.csv: Summary information and metrics for listings in Mexico City (good for visualisations).\n",
